One of the key things missing in the “onboarding” process in most of the organizations is sharing of distributed knowledge. There are knowledge sharing sessions, meetings with different teams, a lot of documentation to read, internal as well as external, some companies use an LMS (learning management system) to organize learning during onboarding. But what happens to the collective intelligence built by individuals over the years in the form of bookmarks? What happens to enabling new members to search for and reach to the right information as and when needed? Knowledge is not limited to the documentation, there is a lot of information distributed and buried in these bookmarks. Many of us faced this issue during our onboarding, didn’t we?

There is a lot of collective intelligence in the teams which are in the form of these bookmarks, highly distributed, lying around in “uncategorized” browser bookmark folders or buried deep down in slack/teams channels/DMs. How do we bring all of this together and tap into this **Hive Mind** to leverage this knowledge base? 

Let us talk more about **Hive Mind** - a definition - 
>a notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing collective intelligence.

Note the words “collective intelligence”, most enterprises, teams are today missing out big time on this. As the world is getting used to and embracing remote the need for this collective intelligence has increased a lot. Bookmarking can help here a lot, there is a lot of knowledge hidden away in these browser bookmarks which need organized sharing.

Bookmarking is first step here which many many users find broken today, here are some samples from twitter -

We hear you **“Bookmarking is broken”** 

So here we are introducing **“TeamClipper”**, a bookmarking solution for teams. Create a collection of bookmarks for your team, and start building intelligence around them. With TeamClipper we are enabling teams not only to have a common secure place to store all their internal and external bookmarks but we are also making these bookmarks more meaningful. Simple features like adding a note/comment to a bookmark or highlighting a section of a bookmark goes a long way. For us it proved to be a timesaver if not lifesaver while we were building various ideas :) As we build more features, we do not want to limit this collaborative intelligence to user action, so we would send you a daily/weekly digest of the popular and engaging content based on your team's behaviour to boost collaborative learning and keep building the knowledge base.

And with this we want to create a Hive Mind in your team!
